								<h2>Role and Responsibilities</h2>
                                <h3><b>Design and Planning Engineer</b></h3>
								<p> I joined Saint-Gobain India Private Limited on  July 1, 2019 as a Graduate Engineering Trainee out of college. I received extensive training on 
                                    manufacturing and processing methodologies of glass used for a variety of purposes ranging from those used in Facades to those used in automobiles.
                                    I was assigned two projects as a part of the training at 2 different manufacturing plants in two different functions namely the Warehouse and Cutting
                                    line. Following the completion of my two projects, I transitioned into the role of a Design and Planning Engineer for a green-field project involving the 
                                    setup of a highly specialized, automated, state of the art Windows plant. Being a part of the project from almost the very beginning, I had the opportunity to 
                                    learn directly from the very best in the industry and effectively contributed in the planning of the whole layout, process flow and majorly contributed in the 
                                    design of material handling system for the whole plant. 
                                </p>
								<p> Prepared detailed 3D CAD Drawings of trolleys,racks and other storage equipment using Solidworks/Creo. A few of my designs are shown below. </p>
